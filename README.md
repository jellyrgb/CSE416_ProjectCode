Problem Statement:
Many people who live alone often want to cook but struggle with menu choices, a lack of ingredients, and insufficient recipes. Due to this reason, they rely on expensive and unhealthy delivery food.

To address this issue, we are developing an AI web application that provides recipes and suggests meals based on the ingredients currently available in the user's fridge. Users can input their available ingredients, and the AI will analyze recipes to recommend suitable recipes. The provided recipes include step-by-step instructions and cooking times, making them easy to follow for anyone.
