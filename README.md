### Problem Statement:

Many people who live alone often want to cook but struggle with menu choices, a lack of ingredients, and insufficient recipes. Due to this reason, they rely on expensive and unhealthy delivery food.

To address this issue, we are developing an AI web application that provides recipes and suggests meals based on the ingredients currently available in the user's fridge. Users can input their available ingredients, and the AI will analyze recipes to recommend suitable recipes. The provided recipes include step-by-step instructions and cooking times, making them easy to follow for anyone.

### Key Features:

**_Recipe Search:_** Users input a dish, and the system provides matching recipes.  
**_Ingredient-Based Recipe Search:_** Users input the ingredients they have, and the system suggests suitable recipes.  
**_Smart Recipe Filtering:_** The platform prioritizes recipes that match the available ingredients as closely as possible.  
**_Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions:_** Each recipe comes with easy-to-follow instructions.  
**_User Account:_** Users can save the recipe when they like it.  
**_Admin Roles:_** Admin add or manage the content.  
**_Secure Login:_** Use the Google OAuth for user authentication.  
**_User-Friendly Interface:_** Simple and intuitive UI to enhance user experience.

### Project Goals:

Create a web application with a user-friendly interface.
Implement AI features to provide recipes to the users.
Ensure security and scalability for a better user experience.
Make an online platform for public access.
